          I enjoying doing all kinds of design work but I love projects that
          solve real problems. I believe in building experiences, designing
          things that are simple & enjoyable to use. My style is to iterate and
          refine through simplification throughout a project. I find through
          each iteration, a better solution emerges. I am interested in projects
          that will revolutionize an industry or product. I am also interested
          in projects that I can collaborate with passionate & egoless people.

            I am a husband to a wonderful wife and father of two incredible
            little boys. I also have a little 10lb Imperial Shihtzu, Lulu. I
            have been so blessed throughout my life and I try not to take that
            for granted, EVER.

            I am a really big fan of liberty, freedom and free speech. I believe
            God gave us all free will to choose to decide what to do with our
            lives. I live by the Golden Rule— Do to others what you want them to
            do to you...

            I started a clothing brand “I AM NOW”. I got a notice of opposition
            from Will I AM from the Black Eye Peas. After consulting a trademark
            lawyer, he advised to shut it down before any real legal action was
            brought to me. See the letter and I AM NOW brand{" "}

            I try to question everything. I am a big fan of going against the
            herd. I really love a good conspiracy. My favorite conspiracy is
            “The Road to Roota”. Check it out, it will not dissapoint.

            I love the beach. I love surfing. I love surf culture. I don&rsquo;t
            get to do it that often but when I do, it makes me be a better
            person. I would give up my design career should the Pro Surfing Tour
            ever call.
